User credential onboarding with KnockoutJS

Introduction

I was reading an article recently on ways to add value to a business and one of the key things talked about was automation. The concept is simple, if you find yourself doing something over and over, find a way to automate it and you save ongoing time, thus adding value to the business. Bringing batches of new users into a system is one of those things that kill a DevOp's time, so I decided to play with KnockoutJS to see if it could help. Turns out it can! The code is presented and can be downloaded as a C# MVC project, but can easily be stripped out and used independently. There are enough tutorials out on the Interwebs to explain how to use Knockout - go Google up the details. This article is focused on how I used Knockout to provide a simple onboarding validation mechanism, hopefully it can assist someone in a similar situation.
